# ☕ Java Ass1.2 – Core Java Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate **Core Java programs** built as part of personal assignments and learning exercises. The programs help build a strong foundation in Java programming concepts like **strings, arrays, loops, conditions, type conversions**, and more.

## 📚 What’s Inside

This repo includes programs for:

- 🔤 Vowel counting and string manipulations
- 🔁 Loop-based logic (patterns, sums, reversals)
- 🔄 Array operations (sorting, searching, swapping)
- 🔣 Type conversions (string ↔ integer, char ↔ ASCII)
- 🧮 Mathematical logic (fibonacci, prime check, factorial)
- 📥 User input and data validation (using `Scanner` class)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java 8+
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- CLI Compilation via `javac` (for console programs)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Practiced Java syntax, logic building, and debugging
- Understood string operations using `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `Character` classes
- Learned how arrays and loops interact for data processing
- Explored conditionals, typecasting, and I/O handling
